### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

This application is using npm packages:

   1. express

   2. express-handlebars

   3. mongoose

   4. cheerio

   5. axios
